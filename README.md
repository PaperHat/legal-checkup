## Installation

You must have [git](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ([Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2018/06/29/how-install-nodejs-npm-mac/)), and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) installed globally to run this application.

If you're on a Mac, please use [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) to install the above.

1. Create a folder in your workspace called `LegalCheckup`.
1. In that folder, run the following command to clone the client repo: `git clone git@github.com:PaperHat/legal-checkup-client.git client` or `git clone https://github.com/PaperHat/legal-checkup-client.git client`.
1. You should now have a folder called `client` containing the base code for the LegalCheckup application.
1. From the `client` folder, run `yarn` to install the dependencies. This will take some time.
1. Once the dependencies are installed, run `yarn start` to start the application. The home page should open in your default browser.
1. Open the project folder in your code editor and look around. Familiarise yourself with the application layout.
