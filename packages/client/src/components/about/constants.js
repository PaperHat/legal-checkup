export const HEADING_TEXT = `About`

export const INTRO = `The Legal Check-up is an initiative from Wellington & Hutt Valley Community Law Centre in conjunction with students from PaperHat’s Cowboy team. 

The idea of a legal health check has been used all over the world and is based on international research that found that people often have multiple, unaddressed legal issues, but don’t think of them as legal problems. Because of this, people don’t seek legal advice when legal advice could help them.

By asking simple questions about common issues that a lawyer could help, this Checkup helps people identify potential legal issues. As this check up is created by, and for New Zealanders, the questions are focused on the legal issues that New Zealanders are most likely to experience, where legal advice could help sort. 

It is a helpful tool to identify legal issues, but does not form legal advice, nor is it guaranteed to identify all issues that a lawyer could help with. Please reach out to your local community law centre if you have any concerns about any legal issues you a facing. You can find information about Community Law services and clinic hours below.

The Legal Checkup does not create a legal obligation between the user, and Community Law, or guarantee legal assistance for the potential legal needs.
